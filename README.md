***Energy Consumption and Prediction***

This project focuses on forecasting renewable and non-renewable energy generation and demand patterns using advanced statistical and machine learning models, including Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, ARIMA, and Prophet.

**Key Features**

Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and scaled data for model readiness.

Model Development: Built forecasting models using Linear, Ridge, Lasso Regression, ARIMA, and Prophet.

Visualization: Explored patterns with Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly.

Google Colab: Used for streamlined development.

Interactive Dashboards using Streamlit or Flask.

**Technologies Used**

Python: Core language for implementation.

**Libraries:**

Pandas, NumPy for data processing.

scikit-learn for machine learning.

ARIMA, Prophet for time series analysis.

Matplotlib, Seaborn for visualization.

**Workflow**

Data Collection: Historical data from sources like Kaggle and government reports.

Preprocessing: Addressed missing values and scaled features.

Model Training: Implemented and evaluated Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso, ARIMA, and Prophet.

Evaluation: Compared using metrics like RMSE, MAE, and R-squared.

**Results**

ARIMA: Best for short-term forecasting.

Prophet: Effective for long-term trends and seasonality.

Achieved high accuracy and low RMSE across models.

**Future Enhancements**

Real-Time Data Integration.
