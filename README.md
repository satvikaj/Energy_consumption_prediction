# Energy Consumption and Prediction

This project focuses on forecasting renewable and non-renewable energy generation and demand patterns using advanced statistical and machine learning models, including Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, ARIMA, and Prophet.

## Key Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned and scaled data for model readiness.
- **Model Development**: Built forecasting models using Linear, Ridge, Lasso Regression, ARIMA, and Prophet.
- **Visualization**: Explored patterns with Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly.
- **Google Colab**: Used for streamlined development.
- **Interactive Dashboards**: Built dashboards using Streamlit or Flask for better user interaction.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core language for implementation.

### Libraries:
- **Pandas, NumPy**: For data processing.
- **scikit-learn**: For machine learning.
- **ARIMA, Prophet**: For time series analysis.
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn**: For data visualization.

## Workflow

### 1. **Data Collection**:
   - Gathered historical data from reliable sources like Kaggle and government reports.

### 2. **Preprocessing**:
   - Addressed missing values and scaled features to ensure consistency in the dataset.

### 3. **Model Training**:
   - Implemented and trained various models such as:
     - Linear Regression
     - Ridge Regression
     - Lasso Regression
     - ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)
     - Prophet (for time series forecasting)

### 4. **Evaluation**:
   - Evaluated the models based on metrics such as:
     - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
     - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
     - R-squared (RÂ²) to measure goodness of fit.

## Results

- **ARIMA**: Best for short-term forecasting with high accuracy.
- **Prophet**: Effective for capturing long-term trends and seasonality in energy demand/production.
- Achieved high accuracy and low RMSE across all models, indicating strong predictive performance.

## Future Enhancements

- **Real-Time Data Integration**: Integrate live energy consumption data to make predictions more dynamic.
- **Model Optimization**: Further refine models for better accuracy with more diverse datasets.
- **More Advanced Forecasting Models**: Explore deep learning-based models such as LSTM for better time-series forecasting.
